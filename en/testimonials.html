<p class="qtext">"As a charitable organisation, the True Volunteer Foundation relies
heavily on the generosity of volunteers to assist with a variety of
endeavours, including website translation. In May 2009, Emilie Hogg
volunteered through the Charity Choice website to translate our website
into French. Not only was I very happy with the timescale of the
delivery but I was impressed by the efficiency, attention to detail and
level of professionalism demonstrated in this project"</p>

<p class="qtext">"I have known Emilie for the 5 years, we worked together, Emilie in
Marketing and myself in Communication. I can testify that she is very
dedicated, reliable and customer focused. I recommend her services to anyone
that needs English to French Translations as she treats her clients with a
great deal of attention."</p>
