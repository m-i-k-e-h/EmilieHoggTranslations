<h3>Early life</h3>
<p>I am a French citizen born in Vesoul, France. As a child, I
travelled a lot, lived in many different cities and acquired a distinct
taste for locations further afield. I quickly developed the skills of
sociability and flexibility which have been very useful in learning the
art of languages.</p>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>I have always taken interest in Economics, Trade, and Current
Affairs; very eager to understand what makes the world go around; for
example what is a Marketing Plan, how to forecast the company sales and
what makes a company profitable etc. Studying Business Studies put me at
heart of the matter. I was awarded the IPAG Bachelor degree of Business
Administration B.B.A having completed a 4 year French state approved
program with specialised functional and international programmes in the
final year.</p>

<h3>Sales and Marketing Career</h3>
<p>Shortly after graduation, I travelled to Ireland. I was really
impressed by how quickly the country was developing; business was
booming all over and so was the construction sector. The Celtic Tiger
(as it is colloquially named) enjoyed 10 years of rapid economic growth,
I was there for most of it! I started working in Customer Service
providing Service and Technical Support for European Customers and
quickly moved into Account Management. I have always worked in a
multilingual environment, constantly improving my languages skills in
English and French, holding presentations, translating manuals,
organising conferences etc. Ireland is also the country where met my
British husband, to bring me to where I am now, in the UK. I moved to
London at the end of 2005 and worked for 5 years as a Marketing
Assistant, writing Sales Reports, Customer Service Reviews, organising
events and branding products.</p>

<h3>Freelance Translation</h3>
<p>My combination of excellent writing skills and wide experience in
the field of sales and marketing is a recipe for success in commercial
translation. I have recently translated websites and references can be
provided on request. I really enjoy the freedom of freelance and work on
a daily basis at providing outstanding quality in translation on
schedule to my clients.</p>
